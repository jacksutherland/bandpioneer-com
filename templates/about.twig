				Band Pioneer's founder started his music career as a Hip-Hop DJ, bass guitarist and vocalist, in the 1990's. During these pre-internet days, he taught himself how to write, record and mix music, using 4-track recorders, turntables, early digital wav editors, samplers, and whatever electronics he could get his hands on. Over 20 years (and many gigs) later, he has connected with other successful entrepreneurial musicians, to bring this database of knowledge to you, to share everything they've learned along the way.
