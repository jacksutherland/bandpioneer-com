# Comment Queries

You can fetch comments in your templates or PHP code using **comment queries**.

:::code
```twig Twig
{# Create a new comment query #}
{% set myQuery = craft.comments.fetch() %}
```

```php PHP
// Create a new comment query
$myQuery = \verbb\comments\elements\Comment::find();
```
:::

Once you’ve created a comment query, you can set parameters on it to narrow down the results, and then execute it by calling `.all()`. An array of [Comment](docs:developers/comment) objects will be returned.

:::tip
See Introduction to [Element Queries](https://craftcms.com/docs/4.x/element-queries/) in the Craft docs to learn about how element queries work.
:::

## Example

We can display comments for a given user by doing the following:

1. Create a comment query with `craft.comments.fetch()`.
2. Set the [userId](#userId), [limit](#limit) and [status](#status) parameters on it.
3. Fetch all comments with `.all()` and output.
4. Loop through the comments using a [for](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/tags/for.html) tag to output the contents.

```twig
{# Create a comments query with the 'userId', 'limit', and 'status' parameters #}
{% set commentsQuery = craft.comments.fetch()
    .userId(currentUser.id)
    .limit(10)
    .status('pending') %}

{# Fetch the Comments #}
{% set comments = commentsQuery.all() %}

{# Display their contents #}
{% for comment in comments %}
    <p>{{ comment.comment }}</p>
{% endfor %}
```

## Parameters

Comment queries support the following parameters:


<!-- BEGIN PARAMS -->

### `after`
