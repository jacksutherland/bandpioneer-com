{{ can('trash') }}
{{ can('vote') }}
{{ can('flag') }}
```

## Deleting a comment

You can delete a comment using a POST request to an action controller, and the following template code. You must supply a `commentId` and `siteId` in your form.

```twig
<form role="form" method="post" accept-charset="UTF-8">
    <input type="hidden" name="action" value="comments/comments/trash">
    <input type="hidden" name="siteId" value="{{ comment.siteId }}">
    <input type="hidden" name="commentId" value="{{ comment.id }}">
    {{ csrfInput() }}

    <button type="submit">{{ 'Delete' | t('comments') }}</button>
</form>
```
