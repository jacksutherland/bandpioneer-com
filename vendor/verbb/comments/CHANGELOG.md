> {warning} If you are using any custom fields, you will need to re-order your fields. The comment textarea field is now content-managed, but added to the top of your form, instead of the bottom as is currently the case. Simply re-order your form fields in Settings > Comments Form after the update.

> {tip} If you are using custom templates, consider reading the new [Custom Templates](https://verbb.io/craft-plugins/comments/docs/template-guides/custom-templates) documentation. There are no breaking changes in this release, but you may find the new method of overriding template partials much less heavy-handed and modular to implement. You might be able to clean up your templates a little!

### Added
- The comment form now makes use of Craft's 3.5+ field layout designer.
- The comment textarea can now be moved freely in the comment form, and optionally un-required.
- Add `commentsInclude` to front-end templates, allowing for easier resolution to default or custom templates.
- Add ability to override only a single included template partial for custom templates, rather than overriding all. For example, you can override _just_ the comment form, or even just a custom field.
- Add `user` to GraphQL comment interface. (thanks @jaydensmith).
- Add `guestNotice` setting to define a notice when guest commenting is not allowed, and the user is a guest.
- Add control panel scenario for Comment elements, to allow front-end and control panel differentiation for validation.

### Changed
- Now requires Craft 3.5+.
- Improve query performance when using a placeholder avatar.
- Improve reliability of getting author’s avatars, adding checks if it exists.
- The reply and comments form are no longer shown when guest commenting is off, and the user is a guest.
- Update example templates.
- “Custom Fields” settings are now replaced by “Comments Form”.
- Provide better handling when custom templates cannot be found. Comments will now fallback to default templates if the custom template cannot be found.
- Front-end templates are now much more modular, allowing for greater flexibility with custom override templates. Hopefully this will help customising templates without having to main the entire set of front-end templates.

### Fixed
- Fix minor alignment issue with field layout designer in plugin settings.
- Fix asset fields and other multi-value fields not showing errors correctly on the front-end.
- Fix custom fields for comments not showing correctly for non-English sites.
- Fix minor sidebar layout issue when editing a comment.

> {warning} If you are using the default JS, but are using your own custom templates (or vice-versa), please update your custom templates to use POST forms for flagging, voting and deleting a comment. If you do not have custom templates, this does not apply to you.

### Changed
- Flagging, voting and deleting a comment is now triggered through POST forms instead of links. Please ensure you update any custom templates to reflect this change.
- Flagging, voting and deleting a comment can now only be done via POST requests.
