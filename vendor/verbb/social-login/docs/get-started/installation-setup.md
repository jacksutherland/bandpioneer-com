# Installation & Setup
You can install Social Login via the plugin store, or through Composer.

## Craft Plugin Store
To install **Social Login**, navigate to the _Plugin Store_ section of your Craft control panel, search for `Social Login`, and click the _Try_ button.

## Composer
You can also add the package to your project using Composer and the command line.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:
```shell
cd /path/to/project
```

2. Then tell Composer to require the plugin, and Craft to install it:
```shell
composer require verbb/social-login && php craft plugin/install social-login
```

## Licensing
You can try Social Login in a development environment for as long as you like. Once your site goes live, you are required to purchase a license for the plugin.
