# Events
Social Login provides a collection of events for extending its functionality. Modules and plugins can register event listeners, typically in their `init()` methods, to modify Social Loginâ€™s behavior.

## User Events

### The `beforeLogin` event
The event that is triggered before a user is logged in.

```php
use verbb\sociallogin\events\UserEvent;
use verbb\sociallogin\services\Users;
use yii\base\Event;

Event::on(Users::class, Users::EVENT_BEFORE_LOGIN, function(UserEvent $event) {
    $user = $event->user;
    $userProfile = $event->userProfile;
    $provider = $event->provider;
    // ...
});
```

### The `afterLogin` event
The event that is triggered after a user is logged in.

```php
use verbb\sociallogin\events\UserEvent;
use verbb\sociallogin\services\Users;
use yii\base\Event;

Event::on(Users::class, Users::EVENT_AFTER_LOGIN, function(UserEvent $event) {
    $user = $event->user;
    $userProfile = $event->userProfile;
    $provider = $event->provider;
    // ...
});
```

### The `beforeRegister` event
