<h1 align="center">Auth for Craft CMS</h1>

Auth is a module for Craft plugins and modules for making working with authenticating third-party APIs a breeze. We currently support OAuth1/OAuth2 providers and extend the [league/oauth1-client](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-client) and [league/oauth2-client](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-client) packages.

As such, this module is an opinionated wrapper around these packages that lowers boilerplate code, provides a consistent API layer and tightly integrates with Craft itself.

> [!NOTE]
> This isn't a Craft plugin that is intended for end-users. Instead, it's something you can install in your own Craft plugins or Craft modules to handle the intricacies of dealing with authentication.
