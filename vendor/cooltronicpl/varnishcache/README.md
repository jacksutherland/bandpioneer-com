## Usage

This section provides detailed instructions and examples on how to use the Varnish Cache & Preload to static HTML Helper Plugin.

### Preloading Server Cache from Sitemap

The preloading of the server cache from the sitemap is initiated once the settings in the plugin options are enabled. The plugin adds the target URLs from the sitemap to a queue for preloading. However, if CraftCMS 4 or 3 is not active, the next iteration of preload may be paused. After the next login to the admin panel, the preload cron will resume. This ensures that all your sites are continuously preloaded in the Varnish Server with PURGE and the static HTML Cache is recreated. For sites with long initial generation times, such as those generating PDFs with your plugin, the preload is initiated on the first website listed in the sitemap.xml. The duration between preloads can be adjusted from the default value of 60 minutes.

### Configuring Varnish Cache

The plugin works out of the box and does not require special cache tags, unless you want to disable Varnish. If DevMode in Craft CMS is enabled, you will need to manually enable the plugin by activating the 'Force On' setting in the plugin. You can also exclude certain URL paths from generating HTML files.

### Using Varnish Cache

Varnish Cache has a settings page where you can enable or disable it and flush the cache. If the plugin is working correctly, you will see the cached files in the `storage/runtime/varnishcache/` folder. To check the performance improvement, please use the browser inspector. There, you will be able to see the improved loading times.

### Disabling or Clearing Some URL

To disable Varnish Cache for a specific page, you can disable this slug in the admin panel or prevent the creation of HTML files for the entire website using REGEX.

```
{% header "Cache-Control: no-cache" %}
{% header "Pragma: no-cache" %}
```

To clear a specific URL with Varnish and some linked HTML files, this is executed by the Craft Job Queue with a delay that you specify as the last argument in the `clearCustomUrlUriTimeout` function.

Example:

```
{{ craft.varnish.clearCustomUrlUriTimeout("test", "https://domain.com/test/",10) }}
```

This command will clear the cache for the URL https://domain.com/test/ after a delay of 10 seconds.

## FAQ

### Q: Are all cache files deleted when updating an entry, or only the ones with a relation?

A: Only related cache files will be deleted and sites preloaded via Varnish after an update.

### Q: The installation fails and plugin does not work.

A: Make sure that the folder `storage/runtime/varniscache` is created and there are read/write permissions.

### Q: How to set Varnish Server?

A: You can use the vcl file from [our project](https://github.com/cooltronicpl/-ispconfig3-varnish/blob/master/etc/varnish/default.vcl) which contains a modified WordPress Purge mechanism for Craft CMS.

### Q: Which branch should I install for my Craft CMS?

A: The 1.x branch is suitable for Craft CMS 3, whereas the 2.x branch is for Craft CMS 4.

### Q: My Preloading CRON failed. What could be the reason?

A: The failure could be due to the inaccessibility of the `sitemap.xml` file or poorly formatted entries within it. Please check the `sitemap.xml` file for any potential issues.

### Q: Some URL Preloading failed?

A: If some URL preloading is failing, you can try to increase the preload time in the Preloading Tab. If the problem persists, consider disabling the preload for the affected page.

### Q: How to reset Cache?

A: To reset the cache, navigate to the settings and enable the **Purge all Cache now?** option. Don't forget to click "Save" to apply the changes.

### Q: What if the plugin's control panel settings don't match the screenshots?
A: You might need to clear the Craft CMS Cache. Navigate to the **Utilities** Tab, select **Caches**, and then click on **Clear cache**.
